- 👋 Hi, I’m @jean98os
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, digital marketing, data visualisation!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Microsoft Excel for data analysis, I just recently graduated from UCC and was studying Digital Humanities and Information Technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a data analysis position and/or to collaborate on data analysis projects! I am especially interested in gender equality; anything to do with understanding more about how women and girls' are treated around the world and showing how important it is to correctly use data that we have, in order to understand this better and to help make positive change.
